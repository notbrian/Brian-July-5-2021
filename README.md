# Orderbook

A frontend project built by [Brian Nguyen](https://notbriann.com).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Introduction

This is a frontend application consisting of React + Typescript. 

You will need `Node` installed.

## Consuming for local development

1. Clone the repo and navigate into it

```
$ git clone https://github.com/notbrian/orderbook.git
$ cd orderbook
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
3. Launch development server

```
npm  start
```
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

4. It should open automatically, but if not access the site at: http://localhost:3000/


## Consuming for local production

Perform the same steps as above but run `npm run build` instead. This will build the frontend (`npm run build`) to the `build` folder which then can be served lwith `serve -s build` or through your favorite server.

The app will be served at http://localhost:3001/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
